- **Directory Navigation:** Navigate through directories using `cd`.
- **File Operations:** Create directories and files with `mkdir` and `touch`, view file contents with `cat`, and delete files with `rm`.
- **Script Execution:** Execute Python scripts using the `run` command.
- **Customization:** Customize text and background themes to suit your preferences.
- **File Viewing:** View text files within the app with syntax highlighting.
